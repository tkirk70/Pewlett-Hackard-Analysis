# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
OSU Module 7 - Databases and SQL

Overview of the analysis: Pewlett-Hackard is facing a massive wave of potential retirees and would like to be prepared.  Our task is to determine how disruptive this change might be to the company and find solutions for a new-hire process.


Results: 
- Pewlett-Hackard currently has 240,124 employees.
- 72,458 are slated for retirement.
- 1,549 employees have been chosen to mentor potential new-hires.
- Almost of third of Pewlett-Hackard's workforce could be gone very soon.


Summary: 
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  - 72,458
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  - So far, only 1,549 have been chosen to mentor potential new staff. 


Overview of the analysis:

How many employees are potentially leaving?  What percentage of the current workforce would that represent?
- This 'silver tsunami' could be disruptive to the company since more than 30% of the staff are slated for retirement.

Will Pewlett-Hackard have enough remaining staff to train possibly 70,000 new-hires replacing the retirees?
- It looks like there could be a problem if all retirees are replaced with new-hires.  The company only has 1,549 mentors for a potential influx of more than 70,000 new workers - a 46 to 1 ratio.

Figure out average age before and after the departures.

   Average age of remaining workers

   The average age will drop by more than 6.5 years if all retirement eligible employees leave.  According to the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/median-age-labor-force.htm) the median age in the American workforce in 2020 was 42.0 years old.  Pewlett-Hackard might want to think about hiring some younger employees to stay relavent into the mid 21st Century.
   
How will salaries be affected?

   Unfortunately there will not be any savings with an exodus of senior staff leaving.  Average salaries for remaining employees are about the same as for those leaving.
